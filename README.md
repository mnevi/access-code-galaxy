## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- Supabase project (see below)

### Backend Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd src/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set your Supabase service role key as an environment variable:
   ```sh
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:SUPABASE_KEY="your-supabase-service-role-key"
   # On macOS/Linux
   export SUPABASE_KEY="your-supabase-service-role-key"
   ```
3. Start the Flask backend:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. In a new terminal, install Node dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build and start the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal).
